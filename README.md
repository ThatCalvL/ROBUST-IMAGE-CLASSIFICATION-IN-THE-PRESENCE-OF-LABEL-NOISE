ROBUST IMAGE CLASSIFICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF LABEL NOISE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF PREPROCESSING, TRANSITION MATRIX ESTIMATION, AND LOSS CORRECTION TECHNIQUES
This report details the development of classifiers with enhanced noise robustness, an essential feature for improving the performance of machine learning models when faced with label noise in training datasets. The robustness of two neural network architectures, ResNet and GoogLeNet, is investigated over three datasets: Fashion MNIST 0.5, Fashion MNIST 0.6, and CIFAR. Our study utilizes forward and backward loss-correction techniques along with an important reweighting approach, employing transition matrices to train unbi- ased estimators for the clean data distribution from noisy datasets. For CIFAR, we estimate the transition matrix using anchor points due to the absence of a predefined matrix, while for Fashion MNIST, we use the provided matrices. Our result indicates the superiority of forward correction in improving accuracy and F1 scores. The re- port concludes with insights into the comparative performance of the correction techniques and their implications for future noise-robust model development.
